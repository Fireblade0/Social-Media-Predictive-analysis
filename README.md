# Social-Media-Predictive-analysis
## Overview
This project explores the predictive analysis of social media usage patterns using machine learning techniques. The goal is to forecast user behavior on platforms like Instagram, Facebook, and WhatsApp based on factors such as time spent, number of posts, and followers.

## Objectives
1. Predict total social media usage for individuals.
2. Identify the most used platform during weekends versus weekdays.
3. Assess activity levels on Instagram based on followers and posts.

## Methodology
1. **Data Collection:** Sourced from Kaggle.
2. **Preprocessing:** Handled null values, data type conversions, and feature selection.
3. **Models Used:**
   - Random Forest
   - Linear Regression
   - XGBoost
4. **Evaluation Metrics:** MAE, MSE, R-squared, RMSE.

## Key Findings
- Instagram is increasingly preferred over Facebook.
- Social media engagement peaks on weekends.
- Age is a significant factor in predicting usage, while the number of followers has minimal impact.
- Random Forest provided the highest accuracy.

## Visual Insights
- Instagram dominates among younger users, while Facebook appeals to middle-aged users.
